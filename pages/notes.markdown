<p>During my time at university, I wrote a few sets of lecture notes/guides â€“ some of which are still being used today. To typeset my notes, I use a language called LaTeX. Here is a link to <a href="https://github.com/cnguyen-uk/Getting-Started-With-LaTeX">a fantastic introductory tutorial</a> written by <a href="https://github.com/cnguyen-uk">cnguyen-uk</a>.</p>

<h3>University of Warwick</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="/assets/notes/MA231_Benyattou.pdf">2015 - Vector Analysis (Revision Guide)</a> <img src="/assets/images/pdf-logo.png" class="icon">
        <p>This guide covers multivariable calculus (integral theorems: Green, Stokes and Divergence) and basic complex analysis (complex differentiation, line integrals, Cauchy's integral formula). I typeset this revision guide for <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/services/aro/dar/quality/modules/undergraduate/ma/ma231/">MA231</a> in August 2016 and it was distributed by the Warwick Maths Society in the 2016-2017 academic year.</p>

        <p><a href="/assets/notes/ST202_Benyattou.pdf">2015 - Stochastic Processes</a> <img src="/assets/images/pdf-logo.png" class="icon"></p>
        <p>I typeset <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/currentstudents/modules/st2/st202">ST202</a> in September 2019 for personal use (and to clear some desk space). These notes introduce random walks, branching processes and formalise Markov Processes.</p>

<h3>King's College London</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p><a href="/assets/notes/7CCM327BT_Benyattou.pdf">2018 - MSc Topology</a> <img src="/assets/images/pdf-logo.png" class="icon"></p>
        <p>I wrote these notes as I took the course because there wasn't an up-to-date set. They cover point-set topology (continuity, connectedness, compactness) and serve as an introduction to algebraic topology (fundamental groups). These notes have since been used by Prof. Igor Wigman during both the 2017-18 and 2018-19 academic years. At least 100 students have made use of them so far.</p>
