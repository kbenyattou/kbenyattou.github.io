<p>Briefly, I hold a Master's degree in Mathematics and find fulfilment/meaning in helping other people achieve their goals. I've just started learning Japanese (どもども) and I love a bit of snooker.</p>

<p>In January 2024, I completed a Level 4 qualification in Data Analytics with CambridgeSpark. The final project, a Netflix dataset analysis, can be found <a href="/portfolio/2024/01/netflix/">here</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align:center; text-decoration:underline; text-decoration-color: #d4a0a0; font-weight: 800">Now I'm actively looking for a job!</p>

<p>I've (unofficially) worked through a few publically available courses:
<ul>
    <li>CS229 (Machine Learning) from MIT</li>
    <li>MIT 6.00 (Intro to CompSci and Prog) from MIT</li>
    <li>MIT 6.0002 (Intro to Computational Thinking and DataSci) from MIT</li>
</ul>

<p>Currently reading:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2006/01/Bishop-Pattern-Recognition-and-Machine-Learning-2006.pdf">Pattern Recognition</a> by Christopher Bishop</li>
    <li>Pale Blue Dot by Carl Sagan</li>
</ul>

<p>Currently playing (at a snail's pace):</p>
<ul>
    <li>Final Fantasy XIII</li>
</ul>
