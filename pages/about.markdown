Briefly:

- I hold a <strong>Master's degree</strong> in <strong>Mathematics</strong>.
- I find fulfilment/meaning in helping other people achieve their goals.
- I mainly use <strong>Python</strong> (<strong>pandas</strong>, <strong>NumPy</strong>, plotly/seaborn/matplotlib etc.), <strong>SQL</strong> and \\(\LaTeX\\) for projects.
- I've just started learning Japanese (はじめまして).

In January 2024, I completed a Level 4 qualification in Data Analytics with CambridgeSpark.
