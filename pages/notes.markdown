I often compile my own personal sets of notes on topics I'm interested in. Here are a few I've typeset in the language \(\TeX\):
<ul>
    <li><a href="/assets/notes/KB100.pdf">Introduction to Python & Algorithms</a> <img src="/assets/images/pdf-logo.png" class="icon"></li>
    <li><a href="/assets/notes/KB101.pdf">Introduction to Data Science</a> <img src="/assets/images/pdf-logo.png" class="icon"></li>
    <li><a href="/assets/notes/KB102.pdf">Introduction to Machine Learning</a> <img src="/assets/images/pdf-logo.png" class="icon"> This is very much a work in progress.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is a link to a tutorial for <a href="https://github.com/cnguyen-uk/Getting-Started-With-LaTeX">Getting Started With \(\LaTeX\)</a> by <code><a href="https://github.com/cnguyen-uk">cnguyen-uk</a></code>.</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="/assets/notes/MA231_Benyattou.pdf">MA231 Vector Analysis (Revision Guide)</a> <img src="/assets/images/pdf-logo.png" class="icon">
    <br>Distributed by the Warwick Maths Society in the 2016-2017 academic year, this guide covers multivariable calculus and complex analysis.
    </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><a href="/assets/notes/ST202.pdf">ST202 Stochastic Processes</a> <img src="/assets/images/pdf-logo.png" class="icon">
    <br>These notes introduce random walks, branching processes and formalise Markov Processes and follow the course I took at Warwick.
    </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="/assets/notes/7CCM327BT_Benyattou.pdf">7CCM327BT MSc Topology</a> <img src="/assets/images/pdf-logo.png" class="icon">
        <br>Used at King's College London by Prof. Igor Wigman during both the 2017-18 and 2018-19 academic years, this document covers point-set topology (continuity, connectedness, compactness) and serve as an introduction to algebraic topology (fundamental groups). At least 100 students have made use of them so far.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>I also leave here my Master's dissertation on <a href="/assets/notes/7CCMMS50_Benyattou.pdf">Pseudodifferential Operators and the Atiyah-Singer Index Formula</a> in case anybody's curious. <img src="/assets/images/pdf-logo.png" class="icon"></p>
