<p>I often compile my own sets of notes on topics I'm interested in. I'll be uploading those in the near future. For the time being, I leave here my Master's dissertation on <a href="/assets/notes/7CCMMS50_Benyattou.pdf">Pseudodifferential Operators and the Atiyah-Singer Index Formula</a>. <img src="/assets/images/pdf-logo.png" class="icon"></p>

<p>To typeset my notes, I use a language called \(\LaTeX\). Here is a link to <a href="https://github.com/cnguyen-uk/Getting-Started-With-LaTeX">an introductory tutorial</a> written by <a href="https://github.com/cnguyen-uk">cnguyen-uk</a>.</p>

<p>I've (unofficially) worked through a few publically available courses.</p>
<ul>
    <li>CS229 (Machine Learning) from MIT</li>
    <li>MIT 6.00 (Intro to CompSci and Prog) from MIT</li>
    <li>MIT 6.0002 (Intro to Computational Thinking and DataSci) from MIT</li>
</ul>
<p>The notes I took while following along will be attached soon.</p>
